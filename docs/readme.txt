All my Linux configs for easy synchronizations between comps.

Deploy them from this repo to the system:

    . deploy.txt
    (then press Shift + Win + R to refresh Awesome)

Copy configs from the system into this folder:

    . updateRepo.txt

WARNING: do not run ". deploy.txt" if you have made uncommited changes
to your local configs!

Addendum: install ripgrep via your package manager in order to use the ",fg" shortcut in
Neovim
